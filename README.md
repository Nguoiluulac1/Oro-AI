# Oro-AI
The official repository for ORO AI - a decentralized AI platform enabling secure, privacy-preserving, and compensated data contribution.
# ORO AI Protocol

**ORO AI** is a **decentralized AI platform** designed to unlock access to premium, private data for advanced AI models while ensuring user privacy and compensation. By leveraging **blockchain technology** and **cutting-edge cryptography (like zkTLS)**, ORO facilitates secure and permissioned data sharing, empowering AI developers to train models on high-quality, diverse datasets without compromising personal information.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Privacy-Preserving Data Contribution:** Users can securely contribute their data (e.g., fitness, health, social activity) to AI development using advanced cryptographic techniques (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs, zkTLS), maintaining full control over their personal information.
* **Decentralized Data Marketplace:** A transparent and fair marketplace connects data providers with AI developers, enabling permissioned access to high-quality, consented data.
* **Compensation for Data Providers:** Users are rewarded (e.g., with ORO tokens or points) for their valuable data contributions, turning personal data into an asset.
* **Secure AI Model Training:** Facilitates secure and auditable training of AI models on private datasets, addressing critical concerns around data ownership and usage.
* **Blockchain-Powered Transparency:** All data access and usage are recorded on an immutable ledger, ensuring transparency and accountability.
* **Scalable & Interoperable:** Built with scalability in mind to handle large volumes of data and interactions, with potential for cross-chain capabilities.
